                <h3>Biography of Hazrat Abu Muhammad Muhiyuddin Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani رضي الله عنه</h3>
                <p>Hazrat Abu Muhammad Muhiyuddin Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani رضي الله عنه, revered as <em>al-Ghawth al-A'zam</em> (the Supreme Helper), was a towering figure in Islamic spirituality and scholarship. As the founder of the Qadiri Sufi Order, his profound contributions to Sufism and adherence to Shari’ah earned him the title of the spiritual pole of his era. His life, marked by divine miracles, unwavering piety, and transformative teachings, continues to inspire millions across the globe.</p>

                <h3>Early Life and Lineage</h3>
                <p>Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (ra) was born in the sacred month of Ramadan, 470 AH (1077-78 AD), in the Persian province of Jilan, south of the Caspian Sea, in a place known as Neef or Bashteer. His noble lineage connected directly to the Holy Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) through both his parents. His father, Sheikh Abu Saleh Moosa (ra), a descendant of Imam Hassan (ra), was a pious scholar and warrior, earning the title <em>Jangi Dost</em> (Friend of Jihad) for his valor. His mother, Sayyida Bibi Ummul Khair Fatima (ra), a descendant of Imam Hussein (ra), was renowned for her piety and devotion. Their blessed marriage, surrounded by miraculous circumstances, was a divine union that brought forth the great saint.</p>
                <p>His maternal grandfather, Sheikh Abdullah Sauma’ee (ra), and paternal aunt, Sayyida Aisha Zaahida (ra), were also exemplary figures of piety, shaping his early spiritual environment. From childhood, Sheikh Abdul Qadir displayed extraordinary devotion, spending his time in the remembrance of Allah rather than in play, guided by divine voices that called him to his Creator.</p>

                <h3>Predictions of His Birth</h3>
                <p>Centuries before his arrival, prominent saints foretold the coming of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (ra). Sheikh Junaid al-Baghdadi (ra), in a state of spiritual ecstasy, declared, “His foot is on my shoulders,” prophesying the birth of a saint named Abdul Qadir, titled Muhiyuddin, who would reside in Baghdad and proclaim his spiritual authority over the saints of his time. Imam Hassan Askari (ra) entrusted a sacred cloak (<em>Jubba</em>) to be passed down through generations, ultimately reaching Sheikh Abdul Qadir in 497 AH. Other saints, including Sheikh Abu Bakr bin Haw’waar (ra), Sheikh Khaleel Balkhi (ra), and Imam Muhammad bin Sa’eed Zanjani (ra), also predicted his eminence, describing him as a beacon of guidance and the <em>Ghawth</em> of his era.</p>

                <h3>Miraculous Birth</h3>
                <p>Sheikh Abdul Qadir’s birth was marked by divine signs. Born to a mother nearly 60 years old—an age considered beyond childbearing—his arrival was a miracle. On the night of his birth, the footprint of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) appeared on his neck, symbolizing his sainthood. Remarkably, eleven hundred boys born in Jilan that night all became <em>Awliya Allah</em> (Friends of Allah). The Prophet (ﷺ) appeared in a dream to Sheikh Abu Saleh, declaring, “O my son Abu Saleh, Allah has given you a child who is my beloved son and also the beloved of Allah.” During Ramadan, the infant Sheikh Abdul Qadir miraculously refused milk from dawn to sunset, observing the fast, and his actions later guided the community in determining the start of Ramadan during cloudy weather.</p>

                <h3>Education and Spiritual Training</h3>
                <p>At the age of four and a half, Sheikh Abdul Qadir began his education in a local madrassa in Jilan, where angels were seen accompanying him, proclaiming, “Give way to the Friend of Allah.” By age ten, he recognized his spiritual rank as a <em>Wali Allah</em>. After his grandfather’s passing, his mother took responsibility for his upbringing, and at 18, he sought her permission to study in Baghdad, the intellectual hub of the Islamic world.</p>
                <p>In 488 AH, Sheikh Abdul Qadir arrived in Baghdad during a time of political and spiritual turmoil. Facing extreme poverty, he studied at the prestigious Madrassa Nizamiya under luminaries like Hazrat Abu Saeed al-Mukharrami (ra), Hazrat Abu Ghalib Ahmad (ra), and Hazrat Abu Zakariya Yahya Tabrizi (ra). He mastered Hanbali Fiqh, Tafsir, Hadith, and Arabic literature, enduring severe hardships, including hunger and solitude. His recitation of Quranic verses like “Surely with difficulty is ease” (Qur'an 94:5-6) sustained him through trials.</p>
                <p>After completing his academic studies, Sheikh Abdul Qadir pursued spiritual training under Sheikh Hammad bin Muslim Ad Dabbaas (ra) and Sheikh Abu Saeed Al-Mukharrami (ra). For 25 years (496–521 AH), he retreated to the deserts and ruins around Baghdad, engaging in intense spiritual exercises, fasting for extended periods, and reciting the entire Quran nightly. His encounters with Hazrat Khidr (as) and miraculous sustenance, such as divine meals from the heavens, marked this period of profound spiritual growth.</p>

                <h3>Founding of the Qadiri Order</h3>
                <p>Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (ra) became the disciple of Sheikh Abu Saeed Al-Mukharrami (ra), who bestowed upon him the sacred <em>Khirqa</em> (Sufi robe) tracing back to Sayyiduna Ali (ra) and the Prophet (ﷺ). In 521 AH, at age 51, he returned to Baghdad as a spiritual luminary, appointed principal of the Hanbali Madrassa Babul Ajaz. His lectures, delivered thrice weekly, attracted thousands, transforming Baghdad into a center of learning and spirituality. His gatherings, attended by scholars, saints, and even non-Muslims who embraced Islam, were marked by divine miracles, with his voice reaching all listeners clearly despite the absence of amplification.</p>
                <p>His famous declaration, “My foot is on the shoulders of all the Awliya Allah,” affirmed his spiritual authority, acknowledged by saints worldwide, including Khwaja Moinudeen Chishti (ra), who became <em>Sultanul Hind</em> through his allegiance. Sheikh Abdul Qadir’s teachings emphasized adherence to Shari’ah, love for the Prophet (ﷺ), and service to humanity, reviving the true essence of Islam during a time of corruption.</p>

                <h3>Miracles and Spiritual Eminence</h3>
                <p>Sheikh Abdul Qadir’s life was replete with miracles, attesting to his divine favor:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>His encounters with Shaytaan demonstrated his unyielding faith, as he repeatedly overcame temptations with divine assistance. His spiritual chain, linking back to the Prophet (ﷺ) through luminaries like Sheikh Junaid al-Baghdadi (ra) and Sheikh Hasan al-Basri (ra), solidified his authority in the Qadiri Order.</p>

                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>At 51, following the Prophet’s (ﷺ) command, Sheikh Abdul Qadir married four virtuous women: Sayyida Bibi Madina, Sadiqa, Mu'minah, and Mahboobah (ra). His marriages enhanced his spiritual devotion, and he fathered 49 children—27 sons and 22 daughters—many of whom became renowned scholars and saints, spreading Islam globally.</p>

                <h3>Final Days and Legacy</h3>
