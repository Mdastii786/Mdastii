                The circle of Kramats in Cape Town is a shrine to Muslim holy men buried in Cape Town. Legend holds that this circle protects Cape Town from earthquakes and natural disasters. Kramats or Mazaars, the holy shrines of Islam, mark the graves of Holy Men of the Muslim faith who died at the Cape. There are more than 20 recognized kramats in the Peninsula area, with at least another three in the outlying districts of Faure, Caledon, Rawsonville, and Bains Kloof.
            </p>
            <p>
                The history of the Mazaars starts with the Dutch invasion of places such as India, Ceylon, and Java. Local communities resisted the tyranny, but their leaders were banished to the Cape. Citizens of Malay, Indian, Javanese, Bengalese, and Arabian origins were also sold into slavery during this time, and these slaves and sultans started the first Muslim communities in the Cape. It was only during the British occupation that the first Mosque was permitted.

                <h3>Hazrat Sheikh Yusuf of Macassar رضي الله عنه (d. 1699)</h3>
                <img src="images/maccasar.jpeg" alt="Kramat of Sheikh Yusuf in Macassar" class="saint-image" height="75%" width="75%">
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Macassar, Western Cape</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> Sheikh Yusuf, also known as Abadin Tadia Tjoessoep, was born in 1626 in Goa in eastern India. A devout maternal nephew of King Biset of Goa, he spent years in Arabia studying under the tutelage of several pious teachers. At this time, the area was in turmoil as the Dutch and English East India Companies vied for control of the lucrative trade in spices and gold, sometimes with and at other times against the various local potentates. When Sheikh Yusuf left Jeddah in 1664, he was unable to return home because the Dutch had captured Macassar while he was in Arabia. Instead, he sailed to Banten in Western Java, where he was welcomed by the ruler, Sultan Ageng, who gave Sheikh Yusuf his daughter’s hand in marriage and made him his chief religious judge and personal advisor. Sheikh Yusuf lived in Banten for 16 years, revered throughout the East Indies for his piety and wisdom, until Sultan Ageng’s son, Pangeran Hajji, rose against his father in 1680, possibly at the urgings of the Dutch East India Company. Sultan Ageng rallied his forces and in 1683 besieged Pangeran Hajji in his fortress at Soerdesoeang. Pangeran Hajji asked for and received Dutch military aid. Sultan Ageng was defeated but managed to escape capture, along with an entourage of about 5,000, among them the 57-year-old Sheikh Yusuf, the Sultan’s two sons, Purbaya and Kidul, and about 1,300 soldiers. Sheikh Yusuf remained loyal to Sultan Ageng in the ensuing war but was taken prisoner when the sultan was defeated. Initially, he was held at Ceylon but was a man of such influence that it was decided to exile him to a place remote from the East Indies, the small outpost at the distant Cape. In 1694, Sheikh Yusuf arrived at the Cape on the ship Voetboog, accompanied by 49 followers, wives, and children. He was housed at the DEIC’s expense on the farm Zandvliet, just outside Cape Town, to minimize any influence he might exert on the DEIC’s slaves, who were mostly of East Indies origin. The plan failed. Zandvliet became a place of pilgrimage for Muslim people in South Africa. Here he died in 1699, but after more than three centuries, his memory and his works live on. The Muslim community to whom he provided guidance, faith, and hope flourishes in South Africa today, his name is constantly evoked, and his tomb is the jewel in a ring of kramats, or shrines. The name ‘Zandvliet’ disappeared many years ago, when the area was renamed ‘Macassar’, in honor of Sheikh Yusuf’s place of birth. “He was not only of noble birth but of unusual piety, a great warrior, a great prince, and also a priest deep in the knowledge of holy things,” the historian Ian D Colvin wrote of Sheikh Yusuf almost a century ago. “Let us hope that in his exile his faith consoled him for the outrages of fortune.” The award was collected by Ichsan Yasin Limpo.

                <h3>Hazrat Sayyid Abdurahman Motura رضي الله عنه (d. unknown, 17th century)</h3>
                <img src="images/motura.jpg" alt="Kramat of Sayyid Abdurahman Motura on Robben Island" class="saint-image" height="75%" width="75%">
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Robben Island, Western Cape</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> Robben Island first gained notoriety as a prison for eastern political exiles, sultans, spiritualists, convicts, and slaves. It is as a reminder of the injustices and the ill-treatment afforded these prisoners that a Kramat is to be found on the island. The eastern political exiles and convicts are truly the pioneers of Islam in this country; thus, Robben Island becomes very much a part of the history of the Muslims in South Africa. Sayed Abduraghman Motura (also known as Tuan Matarah), whose shrine is on Robben Island, is a symbol of the struggle for the establishment of Islam. It is an expression of Islam’s power, having survived all kinds of restrictions, prejudices, imprisonment, and oppression in a land called ‘the fairest Cape on the circumference of the earth.’ Ironically, this shrine was constructed by the Apartheid Prison authorities in the 1960s.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Symbolizes the resilience of Islam against oppression, his kramat is a testament to early Muslim pioneers.</p>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> His shrine on Robben Island continues to inspire, representing the enduring spirit of Islam in South Africa.</p>

                <img src="images/matebe.jpg" alt="Kramat of Sheikh Abdurahman Matebe Shah in Constantia" class="saint-image" height="75%" width="75%">
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Constantia, Western Cape</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> On the 24th of January 1667, the ship the Polsbroek left Batavia and arrived at the Cape on the 13th of May 1668, with three prisoners in chains. One of them was incarcerated on Robben Island, while the other two were sent to the Company’s Forest at Constantia. Sheikh Abdurahman Matebe Shah, the last of the Malaccan Sultans, was one of the two. He was regarded as Orang Cayen, a title which means ‘man of power and influence,’ and viewed as particularly dangerous to the interests of the Company.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Recognized as a powerful spiritual and political figure, his kramat is a key site in the Cape’s Islamic heritage.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> The shrines of the Orang Cayen of Constantia, though the most prominent, are not the only graves of Auliya to be found. In 1972, another grave was identified by woodcutters working in Constantia. The Orang Cayen of 1667 were not the only political exiles sent to the Company’s Forest in Constantia. During Company rule, many political prisoners of high standing were exiled to the Cape.

                <h3>Hazrat Tuan Nuruman رضي الله عنه (d. unknown, 18th century)</h3>
                <img src="images/pic.jpg" alt="Kramat of Tuan Nuruman on Signal Hill" class="saint-image" height="75%" width="75%">
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Signal Hill, Western Cape</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> Also known as Tuan Nuruman or Imam Norman, Paay Schaapie was banished to the Cape from Batavia in 1770. He soon became a respected member of Cape society and an Imam of the small local Muslim community. He was a man with a simple lifestyle and lovable character, with a particular fondness for children and animals. He was known for the power of his “Azeemats,” or talismans, and his services were widely sought after by those slaves who were seeking protection against physical and spiritual dangers. In 1786, he was banished to Robben Island after he had assisted a group of runaway slaves by giving them an “Azeemats” for protection. On his release from Robben Island, he resumed his duties as Imam of the Cape Muslim community. His love for animals is clearly illustrated by the fact that during this period, he dug a hole on the Tana Baru with the intention that it should act as a drinking well for those animals grazing in the area. Remnants of the well are still visible near this Qabr. During the rule of the Batavian Republic at the Cape, he became a firm friend of the Governor, General Janssen. As a token of their friendship, Janssen gave Paay Schaapie a piece of land on the Tana Baru as a burial ground for him and his family. It is on this site that Paay Schaapie’s shrine can be found. Paay Schaapie had a thorough understanding of Islam, and his spiritual work was motivated by this understanding. He gladly shared his Islamic knowledge with the slaves and free blacks who suffered great poverty and oppression in Cape Town. He firmly believed that Islam offered them the perfect solution. The fact that religious freedom was not allowed at the time did not bother him one iota. He went about teaching Islam, instilling hope and faith in a community that was suffering greatly at that time.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Revered for his spiritual guidance and talismans, his kramat is a symbol of compassion and resistance.</p>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> His shrine on Signal Hill and the well he dug remain cherished landmarks of Islamic heritage.</p>

                <img src="images/tuan.webp" alt="Kramat of Tuan Mahmud in Oudekraal" class="saint-image" height="75%" width="75%">
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Oudekraal, Western Cape</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> Sayed Mahmud was a religious leader of the Malaccan Empire. The inscription on the kramat reads: ‘On 24 January 1667, the ship the Polsbroek left Batavia and arrived here on 13 May 1668 with three political prisoners in chains. They were Malays of the West Coast of Sumatra, who were banished to the Cape until further orders on the understanding that they would eventually be released. They were rulers’ ‘Orang Cayen,’ men of wealth and influence. Great care had to be taken that they were not left at large as they were likely to do injury to the Company. Two were sent to the Company’s Forest and one to Robben Island.’ The Dutch made sure that they would distance any influential Muslims from the rest of the slave population as they were seen as a political threat. Sayed Mahmud was captured with Abdurahman Matebe Shah and exiled in Constantia. The Kramat in Constantia serves as a reminder of the courage, fortitude, and sacrifice of Sayed Mahmud in promulgating Islam.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Honored for his role in spreading Islam despite exile, his kramat is a testament to resilience.</p>

                    <strong>Description:</strong> Sayed Jaffer was a Sheikh of the Alawiah Tariqa. He was banished by the Dutch to the Cape. Sheikh Abdurahman ibn Muhammad al Iraqi discovered the grave of Sayed Jaffer at the end of the nineteenth century. There are many other graves of Muslims in the area. Sayed Jaffer’s grave lies near the grave of his disciple Sayed Allie and the grave of his wife. The fourth grave nearby is that of Sheikh Muhammad Zaid. The grave of Sayed Jaffer is located in an area which has often been flooded, yet the grave has never been washed away during the Cape winter storms. In 1970, the surrounding tomb of Sayed Jaffer was swept away in flood waters; however, the grave has miraculously remained unscathed up to the present day.

                    <strong>Description:</strong> Sheikh Noorul Mubeen was banished to the Cape in 1716. He was incarcerated on Robben Island, from where he escaped. There are several legends surrounding the details of his escape. It has been narrated that he escaped by walking across the Atlantic Ocean from Robben Island to the mainland. Another version of his escape is that he swam across from Robben Island, where he was helped by fishermen to the spot in the mountain, where his kramat now lies. He taught the fishermen Islam and became their Imam. It has also been related that he escaped by ‘unknown means’ and found this safe site to live. This was a good site, helping him to keep watch over the area, which included the peaks of the Twelve Apostles and Lion’s Head. He began to teach the local slaves Islam, mostly at night.

                    <strong>Description:</strong> For hundreds of years, residents of Simonstown had known of the existence of two holy shrines situated just above Runciman’s Drive. There, in a forest clearing above Goede Gift, people from far and wide came to pay their respects. In the early years of Simonstown, the community was a small and concentrated one—all living within the immediate proximity of the two shrines. Typical of all Kramats, the area has always been enveloped in an aura of calm and tranquility, an ambiance heightened by the sound of a full stream running along the length of the shrines and down to the mosque, where it collects to form a small pool.

                <img src="images/tuan.jpg" alt="Kramat of Tuan Guru in Cape Town" class="saint-image" height="75%" width="75%">
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Cape Town, Western Cape</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> Imam ‘Abdullah ibn Kadi [Qadri] Abdus Salaam, known as Tuan Guru, the son of a qadi, born in 1712, was a Prince from Tidore in the Ternate Islands [of Indonesia]. He traces his genealogy to the Sultan of Morocco and his ancestry to that of the holy Prophet Muhammad [salla Allahu’alayhi wa sallam]. He was brought to the Cape on April 06, 1780, as a “state prisoner” along with Callie Abdol Rauf, Badroedin [Badr al-Din], and Noro Iman [Nur al-Iman]; they were incarcerated on Robben Island. Their registration in the “Bandieten Rollen” for 1780 reveals that they conspired politically with the English in the East against the Dutch. While imprisoned on Robben Island, Imam ‘Abdullah [Tuan Guru], being a hafiz al-Qur’an, wrote several copies of the holy Qur’an from memory. He also authored Ma’rifatul Islami wa’l Imani, a work on Islamic jurisprudence, which also deals with ‘ilm al-kalam [Asharite principles of theology], which he completed in 1781. The manuscripts on Islamic jurisprudence, in the Malayu tongue and in Arabic, became the primary reference work of the Cape Muslims during the 19th century and are at present in the possession of his descendants in Cape Town. His handwritten copy of the holy Qur’an has been preserved and is presently in the possession of one of his descendants, Sheikh Cassiem Abduraouf of Cape Town. Later, when printed copies of the holy Qur’an were imported, it was found that Tuan Guru’s handwritten copy contained very few errors. On his release from Robben Island in 1793, he went to live in Dorp Street, Cape Town. Here he met and married the free woman, Kaija van de Kaap, with whose family he took up residence. From this marriage, he had two sons: Abdol Rakiep and Abdol Rauf, both of whom came to play an important role in Cape Muslim society, and both lie buried adjacent to their father, Tuan Guru, at Tana Baru. Imam ‘Abdullah’s first concern on being released from prison was the establishment of a madrasah [religious school] at the Cape. He also agitated for a masjid site and relaxation of the hard official attitude of the Cape authorities towards Islam. Such a madrasah was soon established and operated from a warehouse attached to the home of Coridon of Ceylon in Dorp Street. This was the first madrasah to be established in this country and proved extremely popular among the slaves and the Free Black community, where they were taught precepts from the holy Qur’an and to read and write the Arabic language. It played an important role in converting many slaves to Islam. It was also at this madrasah that the literary teaching of Arabic-Afrikaans emerged. It was through his work at the madrasah that he gained the appellation Tuan Guru, meaning mister teacher. When the Cape was overtaken by the British for the first time in 1795, the British Governor, General Craig, was more favorably disposed towards the Muslims and granted them permission to build a masjid. Tuan Guru wasted no time; he converted the warehouse attached to Coridon’s house and used it as a madrasah and later into a masjid, which is now known as the Auwal Masjid, the first masjid to be established in South Africa.

                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Brook Street Cemetery, Durban, KwaZulu-Natal</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> He arrived in South Africa in 1860, one of the first Indian indentured laborers to the country. The 203 Indians who arrived by ship were sent to various parts of Natal. Hadrat Badsha Peer chose the north coast as his destination. Contracts were anything from five to ten years. Those who chose the ten-year option were given the choice of either returning to India at the expense of the government or remaining in South Africa. The Sufi saint chose to remain. The story of how he was recognized as a saint recounts how he began to spend more time in meditation and spiritual exercises under a tree, than plowing and cultivating his designated labor area. In contradiction to his fellow workers’ fear that he would be punished for neglecting duties, at the end of every day, his area of land was complete. And yet nobody saw him move. The British government recognized his spiritual powers and gave Hazrath Badsha Peer an honorable release. Instead of his salary, which they offered him, he asked for passage to Durban, where he went straight to the Grey Street Mosque—then a lot smaller than now. He moved into a tin shanty directly behind the mosque and continued to commune with his creator, giving many predictions, none of which were taken seriously as no one recognized him as a saint. Only years later, when Hadrat Shah Goolam Muhammad Soofie arrived—a great Muslim missionary and saint whom Hazrath Badsha Peer had predicted would come—was he recognized by the missionary who sought out his grave, placed a stone on either side of it, and pronounced him a saint. Today, a shrine stands over the grave. Just beyond the cemetery’s walls, the constant daily hubbub of the market continues.

                <h3>Hazrat Soofie Saheb رضي الله عنه (Hazrath Shah Goolam Mohamed Soofie Siddique, d. 1911)</h3>

                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Riverside, Durban, KwaZulu-Natal</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> Born in 1848 in India, a Konkani Muslim and Chishti Nizami disciple sent to South Africa in 1895. Established khanqahs and located Badshah Peer’s grave. As soon as Hadrath Soofie Saheb arrived in Durban in 1895, he bought a piece of land on the northern banks of the Umgeni River in Riverside, a stone’s throw from the Indian Ocean, and built a humble wood and iron house. On this land, he chose a spot, where the present Musjid stands, and laid the foundation immediately after Juma Salaah. A few members from the community, including Sayed Fakroodeen, Rooknoodeen, and Jhetam, were present. The main builder was an Italian. When the Musjid was completed, it was also used as a Madressa until 1903, when a Parsee by the name of Rustomjee, at his own expense, built a madressa. An orphanage (Yateemkhana) was then built to house the orphans and destitutes. A portion of the northerly end of the land was used as a cemetery, and adjoining this piece of ground, an old age home was built. Next to the orphanage was a kitchen and a place with ablution facilities. At the entrance to the Darbar, a Musafirkhana was built to cater for travelers and wayfarers. An Ashurkhana was also erected here. Later, in close proximity to the Darbar, a piece of ground was bought in Prospect Hall Road for burial purposes. A portion of the land (western side) was used for residential purposes for those who wanted to live near Hadrath Soofie Saheb رضي الله عنه. A wood and iron building, which served as a Mawaleekhana (Rehabilitation Centre), was between the present Mazaar Shareef of Hadrath Soofie Saheb رضي الله عنه and the cemetery. Alcoholics and drug-related cases were personally attended by him. They were instructed to be physically clean, read Salaah regularly, and they were administered homemade medicine from the Darbar. With the very highly spiritual environment and the profound personality of Hadrath Soofie Saheb رضي الله عنه, most of them fully recovered and led normal lives. The Babarchikhana (Kitchen) was situated next to the house of Hadrath Soofie Saheb رضي الله عنه. Here, food was prepared for the entire occupants of the Darbar. Some of the early cooks were Ismail “Kitchen” and Abdul, assisted by Hadrath Zainab Bibi رضي الله عنه and Hadrath Haniffa Bibi رضي الله عنه, the wives of Hadrath Soofie Saheb رضي الله عنه. The last person to cook for the Darbar was Abdul Rahim in 1968. Other members of the Soofie Family also cooked from time to time. The Dawakhana (Clinic) was situated in a room next to the main dormitory of the Orphanage. Every Thursday, people of all races and religions were attended to by a qualified Hakim, and free medicine was dispensed to all. Hadrath Soofie Saheb رضي الله عنه used the members of his family and mureeds to share the responsibilities by allotting duties.

                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> Grandson of Soofie Saheb, a Chishti Nizami leader who passed away in 1978. Known as “Bhaimia Soofie,” he administered Badshah Peer’s mazaar. In 1905, a piece of ground, adjacent to the main road (Jan Smuts Highway) to Pietermaritzburg, was purchased by Hadrath Soofie Saheb رضي الله عنه and placed into a Trust. The area was known as Rooikopjies. Initially, a foundation was laid for a Musjid, but perhaps he foresaw the road widening that was to affect the site in time to come, and he built a wood and iron Jamat Khana on the western side of the land, which was also used as a Madressa. A residence was built for the Imam and the Muezzin. The northern end of this land was used as a cemetery, which is still in existence. Thus, this institution catered for the needs of the Muslims of the 45th Cutting and part of Mayville and Sydenham areas. He placed a few of his Mureeds to see to the daily affairs of this institution while he supervised from time to time. Since it was on the way to the Westville Darbar, he instructed Hadrath Yusuf Ali Shah رضي الله عنه to supervise also. Poor families were fed, and their problems were attended to. Free burials were also provided to indigent families.
